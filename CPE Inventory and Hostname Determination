Disclaimer:
While none of these results were actual vulnerabilities (especially the traceroute and OS detection findings)
I used them as an opportunity to harden the system and ensure it follows best security practices wherever possible.

CPE Inventory: Disabled unnecessary services and verified external port visibility

- Disabled `mosquitto` and `postgresql` to reduce local service exposure.
- Verified with `ss -tulnp` that no TCP/UDP ports are externally visible except expected VPN.
- Confirmed DHCPv6 client is only listening on link-local address, no public exposure.
- System now has minimal external footprint â€” hardened for lab use.

sudo ss -tulnp
*sudo: Ran the command as the root user for super privileges
*ss: Socket statistics, a tool similar to netstat used for 
*-tulnp: 
t: Shows TCP sockets
u: Shows UDP sockets
l: Shows listening sockets only (services waiting for connections)
n: Shows numeric addresses (don't try to resolves hostnames to make it faster)
p: Shows the process using the socket (PID and name)

sudo systemctl disable --now mosquitto
sudo systemctl disable --now postgresql
*systemctl: The systemd service used for managing system services
*disable: Prevents the service from starting automatically on boot
*--now: Stops the service now and disables it from starting later
*mosquitto and PostgreSQL: Programs that weren't being used and were shut off to close the ports. 

sudo ss -tulnp | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | grep -v ::1
*grep -v 127.0.0.1 | grep -v ::1: Filters out any sockets only listening on localhost (IPv4 and IPv6 loopback),
showing only those exposed to external networks

Hostname Determination Reporting: Confirmed hostname via Reverse-DNS

*The scan reported the hostname kali.lan for the IP ***.***.***.*** using Reverse-DNS lookup.
*This is expected behavior for a local VM with a configured hostname.
*No vulnerabilities were identified related to hostname disclosure.
*No changes were required; this information is standard network behavior.
*Ensured that the hostname does not leak sensitive info and is consistent with internal naming conventions.
