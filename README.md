# openvas-first-test

This repo documents my first hands-on experience running vulnerability scans using OpenVAS in my home lab.

Iâ€™ll be walking through:
- Setting up OpenVAS
- Running an initial scan on a Kali Linux VM
- Reviewing and interpreting the results

The goal is to practice and demonstrate vulnerability scanning and reporting in a simulated environment.
