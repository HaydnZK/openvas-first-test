# openvas-first-test

This repo documents my first hands-on experience running vulnerability scans using OpenVAS in my home lab.

Iâ€™ll be walking through:
- Setting up OpenVAS
- Running an initial scan on a Kali Linux VM
- Reviewing and interpreting the results
- Mitigating any vulnerabilities discovered within the scan

The goal is to practice and demonstrate vulnerability scanning and reporting in a simulated environment.

## 2025-05-19: Initial Vulnerability Scan

- Configured and ran a scan against my VM.  
- Found 4 vulnerabilities related to OS detection, traceroute, CPE inventory, and hostname reporting.  
- Screenshots of tasks, target, and report included.

## 2025-05-20: Started Mitigation

- Began researching how to fix the reported issues.  
- Planning to update scan after fixes.
